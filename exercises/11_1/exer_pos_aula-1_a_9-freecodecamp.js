React: Create a Simple JSX Element

Intro: React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. 
For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.
For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.
Instructions: The current code uses JSX to assign a div element to the constant JSX. Replace the div with an h1 element and add the text Hello JSX! inside it.
*/

const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;

/*
As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page.  
You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.
*/
const JSX1 = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
// change code below this line
  ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));
  /*
Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains the following elements in order: An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li items. You can include any text you want within each element.
Note: When rendering multiple elements like this, you can wrap them all in parentheses, but it's not strictly required. Also notice this challenge uses a div tag to wrap all the child elements within a single parent element. If you remove the div, the JSX will no longer transpile. Keep this in mind, since it will also apply when you return JSX elements in React components.
  */
 const JSX2 = (<div>
  <h1>Meu primeiro App</h1>
  <p>Estou aprendendo React</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mais pratico</li>
    <li>menos coisas</li>
    <li>outra maneira de construir paginas WEB</li>
  </ul>
  </div>);
  /*
React: Add Comments in JSX
JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code. Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.
To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax '{/* */ //}' to wrap around the comment text.
//T he code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.
const JSX3 = (
  <div>
  {/*React is awnsome */}
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);
/*
ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.
The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page. You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.
*/
const JSX4 = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
// change code below this line
  ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));
/*
One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.
In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

Apply a class of myDiv to the div provided in the JSX code.
*/
const JSX5 = (
  <div className='myDiv'>
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);
/*
In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the <div />. You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.
Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don't change any of the content - you only need to close tags where they are needed.
*/
const JSX6 = (
  <div>
    
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br/>
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr/>
    remove comment and change code above this line
  </div>
);
/*
There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. The concept of state in an application will be covered in later challenges. For now, think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data. (We'll cover the second way to create a React component in the next challenge.
To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter. Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:
Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.

const MyComponent = () =>{
  return (
  <div>
    <h2>Let's Get started.</h2>
    <p>Oi, meu nome é Elisângelo!</p>
  </div>);
}
/*
class Blablabla extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
*/
/*
This creates an ES6 class Blablabla which extends the React.Component class. So the Blablabla class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. 
Also notice the Blablabla class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.
*/
class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // change code below this line
return( <div><h1>Hello React!</h1></div>);
    // change code above this line
  }
};
/*
When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag.
In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a class component called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent within the ParentComponent. Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash.
