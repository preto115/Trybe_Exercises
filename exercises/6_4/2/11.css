/* Now you have more tower groups at your disposal! 
Use justify-content to move the towers into position. 
justify-content accepts the following values:

flex-start: group items at the start of a container's main axis
flex-end: group items at the end of the main axis
center: group items in the center of the main axis
space-between: evenly distribute items along the main axis such 
that the first item aligns at the start and the final item aligns at the end
space-around: evenly distribute items along the main axis such 
that all items have equal space around them
