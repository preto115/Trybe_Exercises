Your job is to stop the incoming enemies from getting past your defenses. Unlike other tower defense games, you must position your towers using CSS!

We'll start with container properties. A flexbox container has a main axis and a cross axis.

Use the justify-content property on the tower group container to move your towers into effective positions. 
justify-content positions a container's items along the main axis and accepts the following values:
*/
.tower-group-1 {
display: flex;
justify-content: flex-end;
}
.tower-group-2 {
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
}
